7. Design and implement a database using DDL statements and apply normalization on them.

CREATE TABLE Books (
    ISBN VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
    Title VARCHAR(100),
    Author_ID INT,
    Publisher_ID INT,
    Genre VARCHAR(50),
    Publication_Year INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (Author_ID) REFERENCES Authors(Author_ID),
    FOREIGN KEY (Publisher_ID) REFERENCES Publishers(Publisher_ID)
);

CREATE TABLE Authors (
    Author_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Author_Name VARCHAR(100)
);


CREATE TABLE Publishers (
    Publisher_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Publisher_Name VARCHAR(100)
);


CREATE TABLE Members (
    Member_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Member_Name VARCHAR(100),
    Email VARCHAR(100),
    Phone_Number VARCHAR(20)
);


/*DONT RUN THIS:

Our tables are currently in the first normal form (1NF) as there are no repeating groups.

To achieve Second Normal Form (2NF), we need to ensure that all non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key. Our tables already satisfy this condition.

For Third Normal Form (3NF), we need to ensure that there are no transitive dependencies. In our current design, there's no such dependency.

Therefore, our tables are already in the third normal form, and normalization is complete.
